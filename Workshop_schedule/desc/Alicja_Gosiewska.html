    Have you ever wanted to understand and audit your predictive model? Identify its weaknesses and find out what drives its predictions? Then this workshop is made for you! The goal of the workshop is to familiarize participants with modern methods of model verification and exploration. This will be a hands-on tutorial, where we will demonstrate the use of auditor and DALEX packages for visual validation and explanation of machine learning algorithms. The target audience is R users who are familiar with basics of machine learning. The auditor package facilitates assessing and comparing the goodness of fit and performance of models. In addition, it may be used for the analysis of the similarity of residuals and for identification of outliers and influential observations. The examination is carried out by diagnostic scores and visual verification. The DALEX helps to understand the way complex models work. It contains various explainers that are used to visualize a link between input variables and model output. DALEX offers a wide range of state-of-the-art techniques for model exploration. Some of these techniques are more useful for understanding model predictions; other techniques are more handy for understanding model structure.<br><br>
