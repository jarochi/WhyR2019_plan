   Typical bottlenecks of programs in R are (1) loops that can not easily be vectorized, because calculations in a given iteration depend on the results from the previous iterations; (2) recursive functions or problems that require multiple calling the same function. C++ can help to solve these problems. It is a modern, fast and very well supported programming language with numerous additional libraries allowing to perform various types of computational tasks. <br><br>

Thanks to the Rcpp package written by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois combining C++ with R is very easy. Various aspects of C++ and Rcpp will be discussed starting from simple examples that will help you easily replace the R code with often significantly faster counterparts in C++. <br><br>

An earlier knowledge of C++ is NOT required, but it will probably be helpful.
