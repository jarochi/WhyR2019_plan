   The workshop will be split into two parts. <br><br>

The first part will introduce the new mlr3 package framework. mlr3 is the successor of the mlr package. We'll give a overview and walk you through some basic examples. <br><br>

The second part starts with a brief overview of the drake package in R. This package helps you to set up a reproducible workflow of your project. It integrates greatly with the mlr3 package. We'll give examples on different complexity levels and walk you through these.
