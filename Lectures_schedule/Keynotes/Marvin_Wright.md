# Random forests: The first-choice method for every data analysis? 

Author: Marvin N. Wright (Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, Bremen, Germany)

# Description

Random forests rarely win prediction challenges. However, if implementation time and/or computing time are taken into account they are hard to beat. Consequently, in tis talk, I argue that every data analysis should start with a random forest. The talk starts with an overview of settings where random forests excel and where they fail and continues with an in-depth analysis of the reasons for this behavior. Further, I will give an overview of random forest implementations in R and update our previously published runtime comparison [(Wright & Ziegler 2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v077.i01).
