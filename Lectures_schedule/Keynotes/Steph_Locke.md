# Is data science experimenting on people?

Author: Steph Locke (Locke Data)

# Description

As more and more businesses and public sector organisations are using data science to change the way they do things or to automate processes, we’re changing interfaces and interactions. 

- So are we experimenting on people?
- What might our ethical and legal obligations actually be, either way?
- How do we ensure our we don’t perpetuate a culture of unethical uses of data science?
- How to we check out models for the perpetuation of discrimination and bias?

Steph will elaborate on some of these questions to help us think more deeply about our role and will propose actions for addressing some of the questions. Attend this keynote to think!
